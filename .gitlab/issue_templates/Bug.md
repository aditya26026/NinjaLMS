### Summary

(summarize the bug encountered concisely)

### Steps to reproduce

(how one can reproduce the issue − this is very important. Give details about your configuration, be as precise as possible. The idea here is to let the developers reproduce the bug on their own systems. If you have installed Koala LMS manually on your system, provide your Python version number (` python3 --version`) and the list of your modules (`pip list`) − remember to display them inside of a block markup (```))

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

(what actually happens)

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

(what you should see instead)

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(paste any relevant log − please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code as it’s very hard to read otherwise.)

### Possible fixes

(if you can, get the link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem. Anyway, if you can propose a solution, no necessarily a code fix but any information that is the beginning of a fix)
